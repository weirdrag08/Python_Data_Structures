Ques:) Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, and print the contents of the file in upper case.
Use the file words.txt to produce the output below. You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt.


Ans:)
# Use words.txt as the file name
fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
#inp = fh.read()
# ALWAYS USE STRIP FUNCTION INSTEAD OF RSTRIP TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE NEW LINES ARE CUT AND ONLY THE NEW LINES ARE PRINTED BECAUSE OF print()
#inp = inp.strip()
#print(inp.upper())

for line in fh:
    line = line.strip()
    print(line.upper())
