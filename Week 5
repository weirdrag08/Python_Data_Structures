Ques:)  Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.


Ans:)
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
my_map = dict()
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From '):
        line.strip()
        new_lst = line.split()
        word = new_lst[1]
        my_map[word] = my_map.get(word, 0) + 1
max_count = None
max_appeared = None

for email in my_map:
    if(max_appeared is None or my_map[email] > max_count):
        max_count = my_map[email]
        max_appeared = email
print(max_appeared, max_count)
