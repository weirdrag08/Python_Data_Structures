Ques:) Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


Ans:)
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
my_dict = dict()
for line in handle:
    if line.startswith('From '):
      line.strip()
      new_lst = line.split()
      word = new_lst[5].split(':')[0]
      if word in my_dict:
            my_dict[word] = my_dict[word] + 1
      else:
            my_dict[word] = 1
            
lst = list()            
for (key,val) in my_dict.items():
    lst.append((key, val))
    
lst = sorted(lst)  

for (k, v) in lst:
    print(k,v)
